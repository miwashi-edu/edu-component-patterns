# CopyButtonDecorator

<Meta title="Patterns/Decorator/CopyButtonDecorator/Overview" component={CopyButtonDecorator}  />

The **CopyButtonDecorator** wraps around any component with a `data` prop and provides a copy button. When the button is clicked, the `data` prop of the child component is copied to the clipboard as a string.

## Props
- `children`: The component that contains the `data` prop to be copied.

## Example

```jsx
import CopyButtonDecorator from './CopyButtonDecorator';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

<CopyButtonDecorator>
    <MyComponent data={{ key1: 'value1', key2: 'value2' }} />
</CopyButtonDecorator>
```

## Features
- Copies the `data` prop of the wrapped component to the clipboard as JSON.
- Simple interface with a single `Copy` button.

## Usage
Use the **CopyButtonDecorator** when you want to quickly add a copy-to-clipboard feature to any component that provides data.
