# RecursiveStructure Component

The `RecursiveStructure` component is designed to handle hierarchical or recursive data structures. It can render nested nodes in a tree-like format, with each node passing its data to the children. The depth level can be managed, and it recursively renders its structure.

## Props

- **`node`**: The core data for the recursive structure. It contains an array of child nodes (if available) and other properties for each node.
- **`children`**: The child component that will render the node data. This is where you pass in components like `Node` that display the actual node content.
- **`depth`** (optional): Keeps track of the recursion depth for managing unique keys and layout. Defaults to 0.

## Example Usage

```jsx
<RecursiveStructure node={{
  nodes: [
    { id: 1, name: 'Node 1' },
    { id: 2, name: 'Node 2', nodes: [{ id: 3, name: 'Node 3' }] }
  ]
}}>
  <Node />
</RecursiveStructure>
```

## Customization and Nested Data

You can pass in nested data structures to recursively display nodes at various levels. The depth is handled automatically, and each node can have its own child nodes, which will render recursively.

### Example with Nested Data:

```jsx
<RecursiveStructure node={{
  nodes: [
    { id: 1, name: 'Node 1' },
    { id: 2, name: 'Node 2', nodes: [
      { id: 3, name: 'Node 3', nodes: [
        { id: 4, name: 'Node 4' }
      ]}
    ]}
  ]
}}>
  <Node />
</RecursiveStructure>
```

### Conclusion:

The `RecursiveStructure` component is a powerful tool for rendering hierarchical data in a tree-like structure. Its flexibility allows for complex nested structures to be displayed in an organized and readable format.
