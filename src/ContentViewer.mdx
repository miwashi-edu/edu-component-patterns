## ContentViewer Pattern

<Meta title="Patterns/ContentViewer/Overview" />

The **ContentViewer Pattern** is a pattern used in React to display various types of content (such as JSON, Markdown, Images, Diagrams, etc.) in a standardized way. The key concept behind this pattern is that the viewer components are responsible for rendering specific content types while keeping the interface flexible and reusable.

## Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each viewer component is responsible for rendering one specific type of content (e.g., JSON, Markdown, Image), which separates the logic for rendering content from the overall application structure.

2. **Extensibility**: New content types can easily be added by creating new viewer components that follow the same pattern, making the architecture scalable.

3. **Reusability**: Viewer components can be reused across different parts of the application wherever that specific type of content needs to be displayed.

## Example Usage

In a **ContentViewer Pattern**, different viewers can be created for different types of content. Here are some examples of how these viewers might be implemented:

### JSON Viewer

A viewer component that renders JSON data in a readable format.

```jsx
const JsonViewer = ({ data }) => {
    const jsonString = JSON.stringify(data, null, 2);
    return (
        <pre>
            <code>{jsonString}</code>
        </pre>
    );
};

// Usage
<JsonViewer data={{ key: 'value', nested: { key: 'nestedValue' } }} />
```


### Markdown Viewer

A viewer component that renders Markdown content.

```jsx
const MarkdownViewer = ({ markdownText }) => {
    const htmlContent = marked(markdownText);  // Using marked.js for Markdown conversion
    return (
        <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: DOMPurify.sanitize(htmlContent) }} />
    );
};

// Usage
<MarkdownViewer markdownText={`# This is a header\n\nThis is a paragraph.`} />
```

### Image Viewer

A viewer component that renders images from a URL or file path.
jsx
```
const ImageViewer = ({ imageUrl }) => {
    return <img src={imageUrl} alt="content" style={{ maxWidth: '100%' }} />;
};

// Usage
<ImageViewer imageUrl="https://example.com/image.png" />
```

## Conclusion

The **ContentViewer Pattern** is ideal for applications that need to handle multiple types of content in a modular, reusable manner. It allows the application to remain flexible and scalable, as new content viewers can be added with ease while keeping the code maintainable.
