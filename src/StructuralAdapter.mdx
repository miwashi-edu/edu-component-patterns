# Structural Adapter Pattern

The **Structural Adapter Pattern** allows components to dynamically adapt their structure and layout based on provided configuration or data. This pattern is useful when building reusable, flexible components that can handle different layouts, child components, and data structures without modifying the core component logic.

## Key Concepts

### Flexibility in Layout

The **Structural Adapter Pattern** makes components flexible by allowing their structure to be configured dynamically. The component acts as a container, but the layout and structure of the content inside it can vary based on external configuration, data, or context.

### Separation of Concerns

The structural logic is handled by the parent component, while the child components focus on rendering specific content. This separation ensures that the layout logic is reusable across different contexts, and child components remain focused on their content, not the layout.

## Example Usage

Here’s a simplified usage of the Structural Adapter Pattern with an example that simulates rendering content in a flexible grid structure. The grid adapts based on the provided configuration:

```jsx
const FlexGridStructure = ({ config, data }) => {
  const { columns = 3, gap = '10px' } = config;

  return (
    <div style={{
      display: 'grid',
      gridTemplateColumns: `repeat(${columns}, 1fr)`,
      gap: gap,
    }}>
      {data.map((item, index) => (
        <div key={index} style={{ padding: '10px', border: '1px solid #ddd' }}>
          {item.content}
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

// Example usage
const config = { columns: 3, gap: '15px' };
const data = [
  { content: 'Item 1' },
  { content: 'Item 2' },
  { content: 'Item 3' }
];

<FlexGridStructure config={config} data={data} />
```

## Dynamic Structure
The pattern also supports dynamic structures like recursive layouts, where components can render themselves in a nested fashion. For example, the following code adapts to render recursive data structures:

```
const RecursiveStructure = ({ node }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <div>{node.name}</div>
      {node.children && (
        <div style={{ marginLeft: '20px' }}>
          {node.children.map((child, index) => (
            <RecursiveStructure key={index} node={child} />
          ))}
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

// Example usage
const node = {
  name: 'Parent',
  children: [
    { name: 'Child 1' },
    { name: 'Child 2', children: [{ name: 'Grandchild' }] }
  ]
};

<RecursiveStructure node={node} />
```

## Benefits

1. **Reusability**: You can reuse the parent component with different configurations and data, while the child components focus on rendering content.

2. **Dynamic Layouts**: You can create adaptable layouts that automatically adjust based on the configuration provided (like grid columns, gaps, etc.).

3. **Maintainability**: Centralizing the layout logic in the parent component makes it easier to maintain and update layouts without affecting child components.

## Example Usage

Here’s a simplified usage of the Structural Adapter Pattern, showing how a component adapts based on configuration and provided data:

A grid structure might adapt the number of columns and gaps based on a configuration passed to it. For example, a grid can dynamically render a flexible layout with varying numbers of columns based on the user's configuration.

Another example might involve recursive structures, where a parent node renders its children recursively. This allows for handling hierarchical data structures in a dynamic and adaptable manner.

## Conclusion

The **Structural Adapter Pattern** is a powerful tool for creating reusable, dynamic layouts in React. It separates the layout logic from content rendering, allowing components to adapt to different data and configurations with ease.
